	abstract = {Long COVID, or complications arising from COVID-19 weeks after infection, has become a central concern for public health experts. The United States National Institutes of Health founded the RECOVER initiative to better understand long COVID. We used electronic health records available through the National COVID Cohort Collaborative to characterize the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and long COVID diagnosis. Among patients with a COVID-19 infection between August 1, 2021 and January 31, 2022, we defined two cohorts using distinct definitions of long COVID—a clinical diagnosis (n = 47,404) or a previously described computational phenotype (n = 198,514)—to compare unvaccinated individuals to those with a complete vaccine series prior to infection. Evidence of long COVID was monitored through June or July of 2022, depending on patients’ data availability. We found that vaccination was consistently associated with lower odds and rates of long COVID clinical diagnosis and high-confidence computationally derived diagnosis after adjusting for sex, demographics, and medical history.},

	abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) have become a common tool for estimating demand for hospital beds during the COVID-19 pandemic. A key parameter in these ABMs is the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19. Many published COVID-19 ABMs use either single point or age-specific estimates of the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19, omitting key factors: comorbidities and testing status (i.e., received vs. did not receive COVID-19 test). These omissions can inhibit interpretability, particularly by stakeholders seeking to use an ABM for transparent decision-making. We introduce a straightforward yet novel application of Bayes’ theorem with inputs from aggregated hospital data to better incorporate these factors in an ABM. We update input parameters for a North Carolina COVID-19 ABM using this approach, demonstrate sensitivity to input data selections, and highlight the enhanced interpretability and accuracy of the method and the predictions. We propose that even in tumultuous scenarios with limited information like the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, straightforward approaches like this one with discrete, attainable inputs can improve ABMs to better support stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Public health decision makers rely on hospitalization forecasts to inform COVID-19 pandemic planning and resource allocation. Hospitalization forecasts are most relevant when they are accurate, made available quickly, and updated frequently. We rapidly adapted an agent-based model (ABM) to provide weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts (i.e., demand for intensive care unit [ICU] beds and non-ICU beds) by state and region in North Carolina for public health decision makers. The ABM was based on a synthetic population of North Carolina residents and included movement of agents (i.e., patients) among North Carolina hospitals, nursing homes, and the community. We assigned SARS-CoV-2 infection to agents using county-level compartmental models and determined agents’ COVID-19 severity and probability of hospitalization using synthetic population characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities). We generated weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts during May–December 2020 and evaluated the impact of major model updates on statewide forecast accuracy under a SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction number range of 1.0–1.2. Of the 21 forecasts included in the assessment, the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 7.8\% for non-ICU beds and 23.6\% for ICU beds. Among the major model updates, integration of near-real-time hospital occupancy data into the model had the largest impact on improving forecast accuracy, reducing the average MAPE for non-ICU beds from 6.6\% to 3.9\% and for ICU beds from 33.4\% to 6.5\%. Our results suggest that future pandemic hospitalization forecasting efforts should prioritize early inclusion of hospital occupancy data to maximize accuracy.},

	abstract = {Several policy options exist, or have been proposed, to further responsible artificial intelligence (AI) development and deployment. Institutions, including U.S. government agencies, states, professional societies, and private and public sector businesses, are well positioned to implement these policies. However, given limited resources, not all policies can or should be equally prioritized. We define and review nine suggested policies for furthering responsible AI, rank each policy on potential use and impact, and recommend prioritization relative to each institution type. We find that pre-deployment audits and assessments and post-deployment accountability are likely to have the highest impact but also the highest barriers to adoption. We recommend that U.S. government agencies and companies highly prioritize development of pre-deployment audits and assessments, while the U.S. national legislature should highly prioritize post-deployment accountability. We suggest that U.S. government agencies and professional societies should highly prioritize policies that support responsible AI research and that states should highly prioritize support of responsible AI education. We propose that companies can highly prioritize involving community stakeholders in development efforts and supporting diversity in AI development. We advise lower levels of prioritization across institutions for AI ethics statements and databases of AI technologies or incidents. We recognize that no one policy will lead to responsible AI and instead advocate for strategic policy implementation across institutions.},

Responsible AI (RAI) governance approaches including algorithm review board (ARBs) have emerged as important mechanisms to address potential AI risks and harms. We interviewed 17 technical contributors at a variety of organizations about their experiences with internal RAI governance. We summarized the first detailed findings on ARBs in practice, including their membership, scope, and measures of success. We confirmed known ARBs in finance sectors and revealed extensive use of ARBs in health sectors. Our findings suggest that Institutional Review Boards alone are insufficient for algorithm governance and that ARBs are used in tandem with other RAI approaches. Integration with existing processes and leadership buy-in were considered critical to the success of internal RAI governance. Financial tensions between profit and the cost of RAI were a major concern for many participants. Future work should explore measurements of success for ARBs and expand analysis of ARBs to other industries leading in AI implementation.},

	abstract = {Background: Many US hospitals are classified as nonprofits and receive tax-exempt status partially in exchange for providing benefits to the community. Proof of compliance is collected with the Schedule H form submitted as part of the annual Internal Revenue Service Form 990 (F990H), including a free-response text section that is known for being ambiguous and difficult to audit. This research is among the first to use natural language processing approaches to evaluate this text section with a focus on health equity and disparities.
Objective: This study aims to determine the extent to which the free-response text in F990H reveals how nonprofit hospitals address health equity and disparities, including alignment with public priorities.
Methods: We used free-response text submitted by hospital reporting entities in Part V and VI of the Internal Revenue Service Form 990 Schedule H between 2010 and 2019. We identified 29 main themes connected to health equity and disparities, and 152 related key phrases. We tallied occurrences of these phrases through term frequency analysis, calculated the Moran I statistic to assess geographic variation in 2018, analyzed Google Trends use for the same terms during the same period, and used semantic search with Sentence-BERT in Python to understand contextual use.
Results: We found increased use from 2010 to 2019 across all the 29 phrase themes related to health equity and disparities. More than 90\% of hospital reporting entities used terms in 2018 and 2019 related to affordability (2018: 2117/2131, 99.34\%; 2019: 1620/1627, 99.57\%), government organizations (2018: 2053/2131, 96.33\%; 2019: 1577/1627, 96.93\%), mental health (2018: 1937/2131, 90.9\%; 2019: 1517/1627, 93.24\%), and data collection (2018: 1947/2131, 91.37\%; 2019: 1502/1627, 92.32\%). The themes with the largest relative increase were LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer; 1676\%; 2010: 12/2328, 0.51\%; 2019: 149/1627, 9.16\%) and social determinants of health (958\%; 2010: 68/2328, 2.92\%; 2019: 503/1627, 30.92\%). Terms related to homelessness varied geographically from 2010 to 2018, and terms related to equity, health IT, immigration, LGBTQ, oral health, rural, social determinants of health, and substance use showed statistically significant (P\&lt;.05) geographic variation in 2018. The largest percentage point increase was for terms related to substance use (2010: 403/2328, 17.31\%; 2019: 1149/1627, 70.62\%). However, use in themes such as LGBTQ, disability, oral health, and race and ethnicity ranked lower than public interest in these topics, and some increased mentions of themes were to explicitly say that no action was taken.
Conclusions: Hospital reporting entities demonstrate an increasing awareness of health equity and disparities in community benefit tax documentation, but these do not necessarily correspond with general population interests or additional action. We propose further investigation of alignment with community health needs assessments and make suggestions for improvements to F990H reporting requirements.},

This study’s objective was to estimate the number of undetected cases of SARS-CoV-2 admitted as inpatients under 4 testing approaches and varying assumptions.Design and setting:Individual-based microsimulation of 104 North Carolina acute-care hospitalsPatients:All simulated inpatient admissions to acute-care hospitals from December 15, 2021, to January 13, 2022 [ie, during the SARS-COV-2 ο (omicron) variant surge].Interventions:We simulated (1) only testing symptomatic patients, (2) 1-stage antigen testing with no confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, (3) 1-stage antigen testing with a confirmatory PCR for negative results, and (4) serial antigen screening (ie, repeat antigen test 2 days after a negative result).Results:Over 1 month, there were 77,980 admissions: 13.7\% for COVID-19, 4.3\% with but not for COVID-19, and 82.0\% for non–COVID-19 indications without current infection. Without asymptomatic screening, 1,089 (credible interval [CI], 946–1,253) total SARS-CoV-2 infections (7.72\%) went undetected. With 1-stage antigen screening, 734 (CI, 638–845) asymptomatic infections (67.4\%) were detected, with 1,277 false positives. With combined antigen and PCR screening, 1,007 (CI, 875–1,159) asymptomatic infections (92.5\%) were detected, with 5,578 false positives. A serial antigen testing policy detected 973 (CI, 845–1,120) asymptomatic infections (89.4\%), with 2,529 false positives.Conclusions:Serial antigen testing identified {\textgreater}85\% of asymptomatic infections and resulted in fewer false positives with less cost per identified infection compared to combined antigen plus PCR testing.},

How illegal drugs are distributed to consumers is critical in the demand process. To overcome barriers to purchasing illegal drugs, people utilize their peers to purchase substances for them. These brokered drug sales allow buyers to leverage their peer networks to make purchases. For brokers, this form of exchange allows them to obtain drugs for free. This drug acquisition strategy is underappreciated in understanding how local drug market's function.MethodsThis paper presents findings from a brief survey on brokering collected from a random sample (N = 241) of active illegal drug injectors recruited from two syringe services programs in Ohio, USA.ResultsFindings indicate that 30-day and lifetime brokering behavior is common (71\% and 90\% respectively). Respondents who brokered in the last 30 days (n = 181) purchased drugs for an average of 7 people and from an average of 4 different sellers. Among this group, over 84\% indicated that they used drugs with the person they brokered for, 49\% reported often or always inflating the price to the buyer, and 27\% indicated they removed some drug before returning to the buyer.ConclusionMeasuring brokering offers new insight on the dynamics of drug markets, how they operate, and ways to measure their activity. The demand for illegal drugs incorporates the increased use of a drug, changes in the use of different drugs, and/or a novel drug being used. Accessing drugs via brokering accommodates these dynamics. By including brokering in drug market activity, the concept and scope of illegal drug markets transform into networks and not places.},

	abstract = {While pregnancy has been associated with an altered immune response and distinct clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the influence of pregnancy on the persistence and severity of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or Long COVID, remains uncertain. This study investigated PASC risk in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and compared it with that in reproductive-age females with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of pregnancy. This retrospective analysis identified 72,151 individuals who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 1,439,354 females who contracted SARS-CoV-2 outside of pregnancy, aged 18 to 50 years old, from March 2020 to June 2023 in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). A comprehensive list of PASC outcomes was investigated, including a PCORnet rule-based PASC definition, an N3C PASC machine learning (ML) Phenotype, unspecified PASC ICD-10 diagnoses (ICD10 codes U09.9 or B94.8), and a cluster of cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory conditions. Overall, the estimated risk of PASC at 180 days of follow-up for those infected during pregnancy was 16.47 events per 100 persons (95\% CI, 16.00 to 16.95) in the PCORnet cohort, based on the PCORnet rule-based PASC definition, and 4.37 events per 100 persons (95\% CI, 4.18 to 4.57) in the N3C cohort based on the ML model. The risks of unspecified PASC diagnoses were 0.19 events per 100 persons (95\% CI, 0.14 to 0.25) in PCORnet, and 0.23 events per 100 persons (95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.28) in N3C; and the risks of any post-acute cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory condition were 4.86 events per 100 persons (95\% CI, 4.59 to 5.14) in PCORnet, and 6.83 events per 100 persons (95\% CI, 6.59 to 7.08) in N3C. The PASC risk varied across different subpopulations within pregnant females. The observed risk factors for PASC included self-reported Black race, advanced maternal age, infection during the first two trimesters, obesity, and the presence of baseline comorbid conditions. While the findings suggest a high incidence of PASC in individuals following SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, the risk of PASC in pregnant females was lower than in matched non-pregnant females.},
