abstract: Organizations are increasingly developing and utilizing artificial intelligence
  (AI) tools. Responsible AI (RAI) governance approaches including algorithm review
  board (ARBs) have emerged as important mechanisms to address potential AI risks
  and harms. We interviewed 17 technical contributors at a variety of organizations
  about their experiences with internal RAI governance. We summarized the first detailed
  findings on ARBs in practice, including their membership, scope, and measures of
  success. We confirmed known ARBs in finance sectors and revealed extensive use of
  ARBs in health sectors. Our findings suggest that Institutional Review Boards alone
  are insufficient for algorithm governance and that ARBs are used in tandem with
  other RAI approaches. Integration with existing processes and leadership buy-in
  were considered critical to the success of internal RAI governance. Financial tensions
  between profit and the cost of RAI were a major concern for many participants. Future
  work should explore measurements of success for ARBs and expand analysis of ARBs
  to other industries leading in AI implementation.
