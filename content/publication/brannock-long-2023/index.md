abstract: Long COVID, or complications arising from COVID-19 weeks after infection,
  has become a central concern for public health experts. The United States National
  Institutes of Health founded the RECOVER initiative to better understand long COVID.
  We used electronic health records available through the National COVID Cohort Collaborative
  to characterize the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and long COVID diagnosis.
  Among patients with a COVID-19 infection between August 1, 2021 and January 31,
  2022, we defined two cohorts using distinct definitions of long COVID—a clinical
  diagnosis (n = 47,404) or a previously described computational phenotype (n = 198,514)—to
  compare unvaccinated individuals to those with a complete vaccine series prior to
  infection. Evidence of long COVID was monitored through June or July of 2022, depending
  on patients’ data availability. We found that vaccination was consistently associated
  with lower odds and rates of long COVID clinical diagnosis and high-confidence computationally
  derived diagnosis after adjusting for sex, demographics, and medical history.
