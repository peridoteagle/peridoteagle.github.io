abstract: Several policy options exist, or have been proposed, to further responsible
  artificial intelligence (AI) development and deployment. Institutions, including
  U.S. government agencies, states, professional societies, and private and public
  sector businesses, are well positioned to implement these policies. However, given
  limited resources, not all policies can or should be equally prioritized. We define
  and review nine suggested policies for furthering responsible AI, rank each policy
  on potential use and impact, and recommend prioritization relative to each institution
  type. We find that pre-deployment audits and assessments and post-deployment accountability
  are likely to have the highest impact but also the highest barriers to adoption.
  We recommend that U.S. government agencies and companies highly prioritize development
  of pre-deployment audits and assessments, while the U.S. national legislature should
  highly prioritize post-deployment accountability. We suggest that U.S. government
  agencies and professional societies should highly prioritize policies that support
  responsible AI research and that states should highly prioritize support of responsible
  AI education. We propose that companies can highly prioritize involving community
  stakeholders in development efforts and supporting diversity in AI development.
  We advise lower levels of prioritization across institutions for AI ethics statements
  and databases of AI technologies or incidents. We recognize that no one policy will
  lead to responsible AI and instead advocate for strategic policy implementation
  across institutions.
