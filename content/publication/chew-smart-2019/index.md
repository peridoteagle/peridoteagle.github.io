abstract: SMART is an open source web application designed to help data scientists
  and research teams efficiently build labeled training data sets for supervised machine
  learning tasks. SMART provides users with an intuitive interface for creating labeled
  data sets, supports active learning to help reduce the required amount of labeled
  data, and incorporates inter-rater reliability statistics to provide insight into
  label quality. SMART is designed to be platform agnostic and easily deployable to
  meet the needs of as many different research teams as possible. The project website
  https://rtiinternational.github.io/SMART/ contains links to the code repository
  and extensive user documentation.
