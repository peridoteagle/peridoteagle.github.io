abstract: 'We used an individual-based microsimulation model of North Carolina to
  determine what facility-level policies would result in the greatest reduction in
  the number of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 entering the nursing home environment
  from 12/15/2021 to 1/3/2022 (e.g., Omicron variant surge). On average, there were
  14,287 (Credible Interval [CI]: 13,477–15,147) daily visitors and 17,168 (CI: 16,571–17,768)
  HCW coming from the community into 426 nursing home facilities. Policies requiring
  a negative rapid test or vaccinated status for visitors resulted in the greatest
  reduction in the number of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection entering the nursing
  home environment with a 29.6% (26.9%–32.0%) and 24.0% (CI: 22.2%–25.5%) reduction,
  respectively. Policies halving visits (21.2% [20.0%–28.2%]), requiring all vaccinated
  HCW to receive a booster (7.8% [CI: 7.4%–8.7%]), and limiting visitation to a primary
  visitor (6.5% [CI: 3.5%–9.7%]) reduced infectious contacts to a lesser degree.'
