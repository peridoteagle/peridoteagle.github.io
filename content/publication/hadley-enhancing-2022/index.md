abstract: 'Agent-based models (ABMs) have become a common tool for estimating demand
  for hospital beds during the COVID-19 pandemic. A key parameter in these ABMs is
  the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19. Many published COVID-19
  ABMs use either single point or age-specific estimates of the probability of hospitalization
  for agents with COVID-19, omitting key factors: comorbidities and testing status
  (i.e., received vs. did not receive COVID-19 test). These omissions can inhibit
  interpretability, particularly by stakeholders seeking to use an ABM for transparent
  decision-making. We introduce a straightforward yet novel application of Bayesâ€™
  theorem with inputs from aggregated hospital data to better incorporate these factors
  in an ABM. We update input parameters for a North Carolina COVID-19 ABM using this
  approach, demonstrate sensitivity to input data selections, and highlight the enhanced
  interpretability and accuracy of the method and the predictions. We propose that
  even in tumultuous scenarios with limited information like the early months of the
  COVID-19 pandemic, straightforward approaches like this one with discrete, attainable
  inputs can improve ABMs to better support stakeholders.'
