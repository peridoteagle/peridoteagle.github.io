 abstract = {BackgroundDrug policies and interventions require an ongoing understanding of the local demand for illegal drugs. How illegal drugs are distributed to consumers is critical in the demand process. To overcome barriers to purchasing illegal drugs, people utilize their peers to purchase substances for them. These brokered drug sales allow buyers to leverage their peer networks to make purchases. For brokers, this form of exchange allows them to obtain drugs for free. This drug acquisition strategy is underappreciated in understanding how local drug market's function.MethodsThis paper presents findings from a brief survey on brokering collected from a random sample (N = 241) of active illegal drug injectors recruited from two syringe services programs in Ohio, USA.ResultsFindings indicate that 30-day and lifetime brokering behavior is common (71% and 90% respectively). Respondents who brokered in the last 30 days (n = 181) purchased drugs for an average of 7 people and from an average of 4 different sellers. Among this group, over 84% indicated that they used drugs with the person they brokered for, 49% reported often or always inflating the price to the buyer, and 27% indicated they removed some drug before returning to the buyer.ConclusionMeasuring brokering offers new insight on the dynamics of drug markets, how they operate, and ways to measure their activity. The demand for illegal drugs incorporates the increased use of a drug, changes in the use of different drugs, and/or a novel drug being used. Accessing drugs via brokering accommodates these dynamics. By including brokering in drug market activity, the concept and scope of illegal drug markets transform into networks and not places.},
