abstract: Public health decision makers rely on hospitalization forecasts to inform
  COVID-19 pandemic planning and resource allocation. Hospitalization forecasts are
  most relevant when they are accurate, made available quickly, and updated frequently.
  We rapidly adapted an agent-based model (ABM) to provide weekly 30-day hospitalization
  forecasts (i.e., demand for intensive care unit [ICU] beds and non-ICU beds) by
  state and region in North Carolina for public health decision makers. The ABM was
  based on a synthetic population of North Carolina residents and included movement
  of agents (i.e., patients) among North Carolina hospitals, nursing homes, and the
  community. We assigned SARS-CoV-2 infection to agents using county-level compartmental
  models and determined agents’ COVID-19 severity and probability of hospitalization
  using synthetic population characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities). We generated
  weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts during May–December 2020 and evaluated the
  impact of major model updates on statewide forecast accuracy under a SARS-CoV-2
  effective reproduction number range of 1.0–1.2. Of the 21 forecasts included in
  the assessment, the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 7.8% for non-ICU
  beds and 23.6% for ICU beds. Among the major model updates, integration of near-real-time
  hospital occupancy data into the model had the largest impact on improving forecast
  accuracy, reducing the average MAPE for non-ICU beds from 6.6% to 3.9% and for ICU
  beds from 33.4% to 6.5%. Our results suggest that future pandemic hospitalization
  forecasting efforts should prioritize early inclusion of hospital occupancy data
  to maximize accuracy.
